# Boyama: AR-Based Mobile Drawing App with 3D Model Generation

**Boyama** is an augmented reality (AR)-based mobile app designed to allow users to create and interact with drawing albums. The app leverages AR technology to generate 3D models of animals on the screen, providing an immersive experience. The app also includes powerful features for real-time object recognition and model rendering.

## Features

- **AR Drawing Interaction**: Users can draw animals, and the app generates realistic 3D models that appear on their screens.
- **Object Recognition**: The app uses the device's camera to recognize real-world objects and overlay 3D models using Vuforia AR SDK.
- **Optimized 3D Model Generation**: The app processes 3D models 3x faster.
- **Data-Driven Enhancements**: Integrated data science techniques to improve user experience, feature performance, and retention.

## Technical Details

- **Vuforia SDK**: Used for AR object recognition and overlaying 3D models.
- **Cloud Integration**: Integrated cloud-based solutions for faster data processing and to ensure smooth app performance under heavy load.
